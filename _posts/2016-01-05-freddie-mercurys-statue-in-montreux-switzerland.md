# Freddie Mercury's statue in Montreux, Switzerland ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/355aae0a-fcdc-4677-9316-0ea2f3f479cb.png)

I didn't know that Freddie Mercury was connected with Switzerland in the least until I visited Montreux last year. I later found out that he moved to Montreux after falling in love with the place after he played there with the band Queen in 1978 at the Jazz Festival. He even had his studio there where Queen recorded "Made in Heaven". Montreux erected the statue in 1996 to commemorate his stay there.
