# Enhancing Images

Friends, clients and fellow photographers have asked me how
I arrive at my finished images. It's an interesting question, as there is no one-way
to arrive at a finished image. Here are a few samples of some images I've taken
recently that illustrates what the camera sees and the finished image as I see
it in my mind's eye.

This first image was taken with a 50mm lens at F1.8 1/320 sec at ISO 100\.

I enhanced this image by putting it through a little post processing in photoshop. I like using Nik Pluggins by google as it streamlines my workflow and reduces the amount of work required to get to the finished image below.

I enhanced the image by boosting the color. I then enhanced the details and the darkened the background a little, cropped the image and added an additional little bit of vignette to the image. Finally I resized the image for the internet and then optimized the sharpness for most displays.

The following image is of a building. It was shot at ISO 100, F8, 1/125 sec.

Again, I optimized the colors and then enhanced some of the details. I then enhanced the contrast and added a small amount of lens vignette.
