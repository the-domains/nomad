Dinnertime at Mikumi National Park

Feeding a bushbaby while on Safari in Mikumi National Park in Tanzania in 2013\. I highly recommend going on Safari in Tanzania. The people are friendly and the animals are simply amazing. This was taken in the hotel within Mikumi National Park. The Bushbabies would come into the dining area and ask for food. These little animals had become tame from the tourists like me and the staff at the hotel had bananas standing by to feed this cute little critters.
