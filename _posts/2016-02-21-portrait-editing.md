# Portrait Editing

This portrait needed a little bit of help. So I used a little liquify around the jaw and did a little retouching to decrease some of the wrinkles etc.

This is the original file without any editing.

After a little editing... like I said, I used a little liquify for the jaw area. I used a little of viveza to bring out the colors, a little bit of color effects 4 to bring out some details and create a little vignette effect.

The following picture needed a little help as well. ![Grandmother and Grandson](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/937d6317-3471-4bd7-ba87-2afd33df43a7.jpg)

I used a little liquify to reduce the shoulders and arms a little. I also used a little of color effects 4 skin softener to even out the skin. I used viveza to bring out the colors a little as well. I also reduced the wrinkles by painting over them with a light skin color (sampled from the area being retouched) and used the soft light blend mode on the layer.

On both the final images I also rescaled the image to 72 dpi and then used the output sharpener to optimize it for displays.
