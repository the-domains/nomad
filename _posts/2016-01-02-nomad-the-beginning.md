This is my little corner of the internet where I can post images I have taken from all over the world. I've been lucky enough to grow up with cameras my entire life, but I never really got interested in photography until about 2012\. I've been hooked since then devouring as much information as I can find, be they book or videos on every topic you can imagine.

Now I hope to share my visions of the world with the world. It's a beautiful place, and you can often find beauty in truly remarkable and sometimes odd places.

I've been trying to figure out how to design and layout my website for a while and I finally gave up when I found out about "The Grid" and joined it a few minutes after hearing about it. So now I let artificial intelligence design my website for me. I hope this works, otherwise it's back to doing everything myself.

I'm in the process of culling through my thousands and thousands of images so that I can post my favorites from North America, Asia, Africa and Europe. I still have to organize them into nice groupings that make sense. Please bare with me as I undertake this task.

People often ask me where I'm from. Usually they really want to know where did I grow up. Well the shortest and easiest answer is that I never really grew up... as to location, well that's more problematic for me to answer quickly. My father was a diplomat (now a retired ambassador), so I essentially grew up all over the world. I spent a good deal of time traveling and seeing things people save up to go and do when they retire. I guess this is the source of my wanderlust. 

So now I travel as much as I can for work or play. I've been very lucky to have been able to see as much as I have and lived to tell the tale. I will be sharing some of my stories with you along with the photographs as time goes by.
