This is my little corner of the internet where I can post images I have taken from all over the world. I've been lucky enough to grow up with cameras my entire life, but I never really got interested in photography until about 2012\. I've been hooked since then devouring as much information as I can find, be they book or videos on every topic you can imagine.

Now I hope to share my visions of the world with the world. It's a beautiful place, and you can often find beauty in truly remarkable and sometimes odd places.
